# Dexterous ungrasping planner
This repository contains the implementation of dexterous ungrasping planner written in MATLAB. The planner framework based on a sampling-based searching algorithm, RRT*, provides the optimal solutions for ungrasping under a secure and collision-free manner. For details about the implementation of dexterous ungrasping on the UR10 robot arm platform, see [Dexterous Ungrasping](https://github.com/HKUST-RML/shallow_depth_insertion).
